# Porting a New Endpoint

In order to complete the Go implementation of the tracking server, we need to port the missing endpoints. 
The following guide will walk you through the whole process of viewing the missing endpoints, implementing them and making sure they work with MLflow's existing integration tests.

1. [View Missing Endpoints](#view-missing-endpoints): View the current state of implementated endpoints.
2. [Enable the Endpoint](#enable-the-endpoint): Enable code generation for a new endpoint.
3. [Validate Input](#validate-input): Apply validation on the incoming request data.
4. [Implement the Service Method](#implement-the-service-method): Add a new method to the `TrackingService` interface to handle the logic for the new endpoint
5. [Expose the Endpoint via FFI](#expose-the-endpoint-via-ffi): Update the Foreign Function Interface bindings so that the new endpoint can be accessed from Python
6. [Implement the Service Logic](#implement-the-service-logic): Convert the coming proto struct and invoke the store.
7. [Store Implementation](#store-implementation): Add a method to the Store interface to handle the new endpoint's database logic (implementation can be empty for now).
8. [Write Tests](#write-tests): If required, add Go unit tests for isolated parts like validation, and rely on existing Python tests for integration.
9. [Run Tests](#run-tests): Finally, run the Python integration tests to ensure that the Go implementation behaves consistently with the Python version. If required, adjust the tests for any differences in behavior between Go and Python.

As mentioned elsewhere, the Go implementation of the tracking server is currently incomplete. This guide outlines how to implement a missing endpoint.

⚠️ This guide links to local files from the `mlflow` source dependency. We recommend reading this guide locally after running `mage repo:init`. ⚠️

## View Missing Endpoints

Run `mage endpoints` to view which endpoints are not yet implemented.

In this guide, we will implement `deleteTag`.

```
+------------------------+------------------------------+-------------+
|        SERVICE         |           ENDPOINT           | IMPLEMENTED |
+------------------------+------------------------------+-------------+
...
+------------------------+------------------------------+-------------+
| MlflowService          | deleteTag                    |     No      |
+------------------------+------------------------------+-------------+
```

## Enable the Endpoint

Add the missing endpoint to [endpoints.go](../magefiles/generate/endpoints.go) under the correct service. After that, run `mage generate`.

⚠️ This should have updated a few files that you are not expected to update yourself! ⚠️

### New fiber route

In [pkg/server/routes/tracking.g.go](../pkg/server/routes/tracking.g.go), a new route was added:

```go
	app.Post("/mlflow/runs/delete-tag", func(ctx *fiber.Ctx) error {
		input := &protos.DeleteTag{}
		if err := parser.ParseBody(ctx, input); err != nil {
			return err
		}
		output, err := service.DeleteTag(utils.NewContextWithLoggerFromFiberContext(ctx), input)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		return ctx.JSON(output)
	})
```

This means that our Go server will now process the API request.

### New Service Method

In [pkg/contract/service/tracking.g.go](../pkg/contract/service/tracking.g.go), the interface has a new function that we need to implement, which is used in the routes file above.

```go
type TrackingService interface {
    ...
	DeleteTag(ctx context.Context, input *protos.DeleteTag) (*protos.DeleteTag_Response, *contract.Error)
}
```

### New FFI Endpoint

In [pkg/lib/tracking.g.go](../pkg/lib/tracking.g.go), a new FFI endpoint was generated.

```go
//export TrackingServiceDeleteTag
func TrackingServiceDeleteTag(serviceID int64, requestData unsafe.Pointer, requestSize C.int, responseSize *C.int) unsafe.Pointer {
	service, err := trackingServices.Get(serviceID)
	if err != nil {
		return makePointerFromError(err, responseSize)
	}
	return invokeServiceMethod(service.DeleteTag, new(protos.DeleteTag), requestData, requestSize, responseSize)
}
```

We will later create a Python binding to enable us to invoke this generated Go code.

## Validate Input

A first step to port an endpoint would be to check the request validation happening at the HTTP level. Open [handlers.py](../.mlflow.repo/mlflow/server/handlers.py) (from the `.mlflow.repo`) to see which fields are required.

```python
@catch_mlflow_exception
@_disable_if_artifacts_only
def _delete_tag():
    request_message = _get_request_message(
        DeleteTag(),
        schema={
            "run_id": [_assert_required, _assert_string],
            "key": [_assert_required, _assert_string],
        },
    )
    _get_tracking_store().delete_tag(request_message.run_id, request_message.key)
    response_message = DeleteTag.Response()
    response = Response(mimetype="application/json")
    response.set_data(message_to_json(response_message))
    return response
```

We notice that `run_id` and `key` are required. To avoid writing repetitive code in Go, we make use of [Go validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) and use annotations to validate the incoming structs.

To ensure parity, we need to update the input struct `DeleteTag` from the generated proto code ([pkg/protos/service.pb.go](../pkg/protos/service.pb.go)) with annotations. ⚠️ Since this file was generated, we don't want to modify it directly. ⚠️ Instead, we will configure validations in [validations.go](../magefiles/generate/validations.go).

```go
var validations = map[string]string{
    ...
	"DeleteTag_RunId":                    "required",
	"DeleteTag_Key":                      "required",
}
```

After that, run `mage generate` again and check if our fields in `DeleteTag` now contain `validate:"required"`.

Note that we do not need to process `_assert_string` because in Go, all structs are already statically typed.

It may happen that the [baked-in validations](https://github.com/go-playground/validator?tab=readme-ov-file#baked-in-validations) of the Go validator are not sufficient. If this occurs, please create a [custom validation rule](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10#hdr-Custom_Validation_Functions) in [pkg/validation/validation.go](../pkg/validation/validation.go).

## Implement the Service Logic

We aim to keep the Go implementation as close to the Python code as possible. That's why we have a thin service layer and keep most logic in the (SQL) store instead of the service. This keeps things similar to Python, making it easier to port and compare the code.

In the [pkg/tracking/service/service.go](../pkg/tracking/service/service.go), we need to call the store with the same arguments as the Python store would be called:

```python
# handlers.py
_get_tracking_store().delete_tag(request_message.run_id, request_message.key)
```

We split up the service over multiple files (one Go file per entity), sometimes it might not exist yet.
This is typically where we convert proto structs to entities. In the case of `deleteTag`, we can just pass the two arguments to the store.

In [tags.go](../pkg/tracking/service/tags.go):

```go
func (ts TrackingService) DeleteTag(ctx context.Context, input *protos.DeleteTag) (*protos.DeleteTag_Response, *contract.Error) {
    // Note that Store.DeleteTag does not exist yet; this just mirrors what happens in delete_tag() in handlers.py
	// We do pass in the context, this is a Go specfic detail.
	if err := ts.Store.DeleteTag(ctx, input.GetRunId(), input.GetKey()); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &protos.DeleteTag_Response{}, nil
}
```

## Expose the Endpoint via FFI

To access our new endpoint in the Python FFI binding, we need to update our Python store as well. Update [mlflow_go/store/tracking.py](../mlflow_go/store/tracking.py) and add the method matching our endpoint from [.mlflow.repo/mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py](../.mlflow.repo/mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py):

```python
def delete_tag(self, run_id, key):
	request = DeleteTag(run_id=run_id, key=key)
	self.service.call_endpoint(get_lib().TrackingServiceDeleteTag, request)
```

Note that `DeleteTag` and `TrackingServiceDeleteTag` will match our newly generated code in [pkg/lib/tracking.g.go](../pkg/lib/tracking.g.go).

## Store Implementation

In the future, we hope to implement the file store in Go as well. That’s why we use a store interface to abstract away all SQL details, which also makes testing easier.

Update [store.go](../pkg/tracking/store/store.go):

```go
	RunTrackingStore interface {
		...
		DeleteTag(ctx context.Context, runID, key string) *contract.Error
	}
```

Then, add an empty implementation in [store/sql/tags.go](../pkg/tracking/store/sql/tags.go):

```go
func (s TrackingSQLStore) DeleteTag(
	ctx context.Context, runID string, key string,
) *contract.Error {
	return nil
}
```

Lastly, update the `TrackingStore` interface mock via `go generate ./...`.
(In Go, `...` means all files recursively)

If everything goes well, you should be able to run `mage test:unit` to execute the Go unit tests. This serves as a sanity check to verify that the Go code is compiling.

### The Actual Store Implementation

At this point, we need to write the actual implementation. Again, we want to stay true to the Python code, so please refer to [sqlalchemy_store.py](../.mlflow.repo/mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py).

It is important that the same data and exceptions are returned to ensure the Go implementation behaves like the Python one, allowing users to seamlessly switch to Go while having the same experience.

Don’t hesitate to challenge the current implementation of the Python code. You might find opportunities to revisit and improve parts of it.

#### Validation in the store

Additional validation may be present in the Python store objects. For example, the `_validate_tag_name` function is used in [mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py](../.mlflow.repo/mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py). In Go, we handle this type of validation earlier through [input validation](#validate-input).

## Write Tests

Depending on the endpoint you are porting, you may want to add Go unit tests or rely on the existing Python integration tests. It really depends on the complexity of the endpoint. 

As a rule of thumb, add Go unit tests for clear-cut isolated parts, like validation logic, and keep integration tests for the actual database layer. Avoid tests that are too closely coupled to the implementation. It’s sometimes acceptable not to have any Go unit tests if the existing Python tests adequately cover the endpoint.

### Go unit tests

An example use case where unit tests proved to be highly beneficial is the `filter` and `order` parser in the [search-runs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html#search-runs) endpoint. The [query_test.go](../pkg/tracking/service/query/query_test.go) file tests the more complex implementation of the endpoint, which has no external dependencies.

## Run Tests

Run `mage test:python` and verify that our Go implementation passes the existing tests. You can also use `mage test:pythonSpecific <testname>` to run a specific set of tests.

There is one caveat to these tests; occasionally, they may have a Python bias, meaning that the tests pass due to Python's dynamic nature, while our Go tests might fail because they are strongly typed. Another issue may arise if the Python implementation does not consistently return the same error messages. Therefore, it may be necessary to submit a PR to [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) to adjust the existing tests.
